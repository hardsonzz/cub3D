# CUB3D by Luke Smit
## PRESENTATION

This project aims at reproducing a basic FPS game by using the raycasting method, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).
The project is made in C language and uses the MLX library as software.

| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `ESC`         | exit game     |

Watch out for the scary nuns in the maze who will try to kill you if you get too close.

</p>

If you do encounter a nun you can try to kill it, but becareful! They will hurt you!

### Modifications üë®‚Äçüé®
You can now create your own map by following this norm:
| Object         | Code          |
| -------------  |:-------------:|
| `1`            | wall          |
| `0`            | floor         |
| `2`            | non sprite    |
| `3`            | coin sprite   |
| `N`/`E`/`W`/`S`| player spawn position + orientation|

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful ! All your paths must be valid and your map must be closed (but not necessarily a square)

You can have a look at the cub3D.pdf file for further details of the project.
